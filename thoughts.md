**takeaways from my first two sessions in Mod0 at Turing**

Turing doesn't just teach coding, they teach professional development needed to be successful in the industry. We are practicing communicating on Slack, we are going to build our GitHub repository for employers to see, learning how to keep it all looking professional.
I also like that we are really learning how to network, use our programs and screens effectively, schedule ourselves for projects, and preparing some foundations for the coding we are going to do later.

**strategies I'm committed to trying during the rest of Mod0**

The first thing I'm trying that I haven't ever done before is very specific time scheduling for homework and prework. Normally I'd just leave all of my time outside of class and appointments open and use it to do whatever tasks I want to tackle at the time. After using the calendar assignment to map out how I plan to use my time, I see how I do need to be much more mindful of using certain time for specific projects!
I'm also committing to really trying to interact with my cohort mates. Usually I keep to myself and focus on my technical work, but Turing really encourages the benefits of making connections with everyone around you and how beneficial that is for your coursework and profession life later.

A huge thank you to my friend Sergio for contacting me to cheer me on before my first class and checking in to see how its going!
