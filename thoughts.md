**takeaways from my first two sessions in Mod0 at Turing**

Turing doesn't just teach coding, they teach professional development needed to be successful in the industry. We are practicing communicating on Slack, we are going to build our GitHub repository for employers to see, learning how to keep it all looking professional.
I also like that we are really learning how to network, use our programs and screens effectively, schedule ourselves for projects, and preparing some foundations for the coding we are going to do later.
